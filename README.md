### Tuts+ Course: Gaming With EaselJS
**Instructor: Jason Green**

In this course we'll be jumping right into the action and building out the basic functionality of two real game projects. Using the canvas framework, EaselJS, we'll make a simple tile based puzzle game and a scrolling space shooter. You should already have a fundemental understanding of the Canvas APIs, or you can checkout [Canvas Essentials](http://code.tutsplus.com/courses/canvas-essentials), a starter course which will get you up to speed with what's going on under the hood.
